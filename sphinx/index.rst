Technological advancements have led to significant changes in society. 
The earliest known technology is the stone tool, used during prehistoric times, followed by the control of fire,
which contributed to the growth of the human brain and the development of language during the Ice Age.

**Etymology**
=========================================================================================================================================================================================================

Technology is a term dating back to the early 17th century that meant 'systematic treatment'.
It is predated in use by the Ancient Greek word tékhnē, used to mean 'knowledge of how to make things', which encompassed activities like architecture.

Starting in the 19th century, continental Europeans started using the terms Technik (German) or technique (French) to refer to a 'way of doing', 
which included all technical arts, such as dancing, navigation, or printing, whether or not they required tools or instruments.
At the time, Technologie (German and French) referred either to the academic discipline studying the "methods of arts and crafts", or to the political discipline "intended to legislate on the functions of the arts and crafts.
Since the distinction between Technik and Technologie is absent in English, both were translated as technology. The term was previously uncommon in English and mostly referred to the academic discipline, as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

   a) Impact.
   b) Social.

Recent years have brought about a rise in social media's cultural prominence, with potential repercussions on democracy, and economic and social life.
 Early on, the internet was seen as a "liberation technology" that would democratize knowledge, improve access to education, and promote democracy. 
 Modern research has turned to investigate the internet's downsides, including disinformation, polarization, hate speech, and propaganda.

Since the 1970s, technology's impact on the environment has been criticized, leading to a surge in investment in solar, wind, and other forms of clean energy.
