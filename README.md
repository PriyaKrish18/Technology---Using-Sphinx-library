# Technology---Using-Sphinx-library
I have developed an website using Sphinx library in python where it acts like an professional user document website.

Procedure:

Step -1 :  Create an virtual environment separetely to create an website and install the sphinx library.
Step -2 :  Then create an new directory and install all the required documents after activating the respective environment.
Step -3 :  In the index.rst file enter the code to be generated and after entering the code, in the command prompt type "make html"
Step -4 :  The beauty of sphinx is that it automatically generates the html code after using this command which autobuilds the html code depending on the rst file.
Step -5 :  Then it generates an website on the chrome or respective web browser when you run the index.html file.
